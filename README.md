> Updated : 31 March 2016

Get involved in submitting and building new PyroCMS projects, modules and addons ideas to be built by a community of awesome PHP developers creating open source software. 

All requests are going to be maintained in the issues tracker of this repository.

- [Create a request](https://github.com/websemantics/pyrocms-requests/issues/new)

- [Browse and discuss ideas and requests](https://github.com/websemantics/pyrocms-requests/issues)


# Requests Template

When creating an idea request for a project or an addon, a list of [questions](https://github.com/websemantics/pyrocms-requests/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) are proposed using [Github Issues Template](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) feature. To request a change to the list of questions or add new ones, create a pull request.


## How It Works

Once an idea has been fleshed out and has interest from a group of people who want to work on it, we can create a repository and assign an initial core team to build it. That team will have full control over how the project is executed.

Everyone else is free to submit pull requests to the project's repository and the core team can request that helpful contributors be added to the team.


## Need Help?

Have an idea thatyou already started work on? Do you want others to collaborate with you on the project and promotion? Submit an [issue](https://github.com/websemantics/pyrocms-requests/issues/new) describing your idea and requesting other developers to join you working on it.
